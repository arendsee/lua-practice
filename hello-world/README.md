# Hello Lua

As always, I start with a hello world program to test that everything is
working on my system. I retrieved the `lua` interpreter with no problems (it
was in my distro's repository). Running the it without arguments takes me into
a shell. Here I just wrote the first thing that came to mind `print("hello
world")`, which worked as expected. Writing this into a file and adding it as
an argument works fine too. Sweet.

So the system seems fine, no ugly surpises (well, I wasn't expecting any for
a language like Lua).

One odd thing was that my package manager ('apt') offered several different
versions of `lua`: `lua5.1`, `lua5.3`, `lua50`. I should check whether for
schisms.
